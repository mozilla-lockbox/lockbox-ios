# Release Notes

## 1.0 (Build ???????)

_Date: 2018-05-14_

This build DOES include: signing in with Firefox Accounts to see your real "Saved Logins" data from Firefox; automatic locking with biometrics (Touch ID / Face ID) to prevent access to your data; searching and sorting items; showing/hiding passwords; coping usernames and passwords to the pasteboard (which expire after 60 seconds); opening web addresses in your preferred web browser.

This build DOES NOT include: user-friendly item titles; links to real FAQ content; proper visual placeholders when an initial sync is occurring or when no items are found.

Some KNOWN ISSUES include: the app may crash a couple times on first-run â€” just open the app again so it can fix itself; if you navigate away from the list view and a sync occurs it will pop you back into the list view; the search/filter keyboard is immediately dismissed after each character you type. Don't worry, we'll get these fixed soon!
