# Release Notes

## 1.0 (Build ???????)

_Date: 2018-05-14_

This build DOES include: signing in with Firefox Accounts to see your real "Saved Logins" data from Firefox; automatic locking with biometrics (Touch ID / Face ID) to prevent access to your data; searching and sorting items; showing/hiding passwords; coping usernames and passwords to the pasteboard (which expire after 60 seconds); opening web addresses in your preferred web browser; Telemetry for event tracking (no personally-identifiable information is collected).

This build DOES NOT include: user-friendly item titles; links to real FAQ content; proper visual placeholders when an initial sync is occurring or when no items are found.

Some KNOWN ISSUES include: when navigating away from the list view and a sync occurs in the background the app will pop you back into the list view; the search/filter keyboard is immediately dismissed after the first and second character you type. Don't worry, we'll get these fixed soon!

Please also note: the app may crash on first-run â€” just open it again and please let us know if you encounter this. We believe we squashed all the bugs but need your help making sure.
